# Fast Gaussian Simulation

## What is it?
Fast Gaussian Simulation (FGS) is a matlab function which generate multiple n-D Gaussian field very quickly. It uses the Fast Fourrier Transform (FFT).

## Where to start?
The [LiveScript demo ``script.mlx`` ](https://gaia-unil.github.io/FastGaussianSimulation/html/script) shows you how to set-up the parameter for the function with a 2D and a 3D exemple.
The  app demo ``app.mlapp`` is a nice GUI to simulate Gaussian field.
